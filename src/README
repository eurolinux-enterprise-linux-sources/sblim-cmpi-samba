SBLIM CMPI Samba Instrumentation README
--------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The cmpi-samba package provides access to the samba configuration data 
via CIMOM technology/infrastructure.


Client Interface
----------------
Since the usage of the CIM Client API is not userfriendly enough to manage the 
complexity of the task, a Web Based front end has been developed and published 
on the SBLIM project page on SourceForge.
The Client Interface allows to configure the service properly and offers 
guidance in the form of wizards to create new entities or make other complex
configuration.
It can be retrieved from the following URL:
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128809&package_id=214076


Management Application
----------------------
This package includes only the instrumentation and does not offer a management
application. The management application is available for download on
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128809&package_id=214076
Please refer to the README of the sblim-wbemsmt-* packages on how to setup the
system to get the application running.


Package Contents
----------------

./README                This file
./model/*               Contains Linux_Samba-Model.mof and corresponding Rational model .emx file
./provider/*            The instrumented classes/associations    
./resource-access/*     cmpi-samba specific resource access layer code 

If checked out from CVS:
./autoconfiscate.sh contains support to setup the autoconf/automake build environment 


Build-time Prerequisites
------------------------
- CMPI enabled CIMOM installed (e.g. Pegasus 2.5)
- CMPI C++ header files and library installed
- automake 1.9.2 or higher
- libtool 1.5.8 or higher 
- tools-libra built and installed

Run-time Prerequisites
----------------------
- CMPI enabled CIMOM installed 
- Pegasus 2.5 requires Patch for Pegasus Bug 4220
- CMPI C++ library installed
- CIM Schema Version 2.9 or higher loaded into the CIMOM's repository
- CIMOM running as root
- Python interpreter 
- samba 3.0.10 or higher
- correctly configured properties in smt_smb_ra_support.conf
 
Build/Install Instructions
--------------------------

The simplest way to compile and install this package is:

  1. Check your system to provide the libcmpiCppImpl.so library. If this is not the case, but
     libcmpiCppImpl.so.1 is present, this can easily be linked to get the dependency solved.

  2. If checked out from CVS 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     './autoconfiscate.sh' to setup the autoconf/automake build environment.
       
  3. Type './configure' to configure the package for your system.

  4. Type 'make' to build the libraries

  5. su to root and type 'make install' to install the libraries and the header files.

  6. su to root and type 'make postinstall' to load and register the classes/associations and their providers

This package is GNU autotool enabled, refer to the file named INSTALL for generic instructions.

The generated configure script tries to determine where the CMPI header files
are located. For this purpose it searches a set of well-known locations.
The "canonical" location is /usr/include/cmpi or /usr/local/include/cmpi,
depending on how configure is invoked.

Additionally, configure checks for the 'libcmpiCppImpl.so' library because the providers are
implemented in C++ and so the CMPI C++ library is required for the build process.
tog-pegasus includes the libcmpiCppImpl.so.1 but this is not sufficient. tog-pegasus-devel
should normally create the link from libcmpiCppImpl.so.1 to libcmpiCppImpl.so but it does 
not since version 2.5.2. In the case you want to run the CMPI provider in the OpenPegasus
environment, please create the link manually to fullfill this requirement.

Further, configure "determines" where providers are to be installed. Actually,
there's no detection logic. The provider directory will always be
/usr/lib/cmpi or /usr/local/lib/cmpi. If a CIM server requires a particular
directory this can be selected by specifying the PROVIDERDIR variable.

And finally, configure tries to find out which CIM server type is being used.
This is necessary in order to select the appropriate schema and provider
registration technique. If the CIM server is not or incorrectly identified,
it is possible to specify it via the CIMSERVER variable.
Supported values are pegasus, sfcb, openwbem and sniacimom.

For instance, in order to configure for a locally installed Pegasus you can
issue the following command:
./configure CIMSERVER=pegasus PROVIDERDIR=$PEGASUS_HOME/lib

Load Schema into CIMOM's repository
-----------------------------------

- with Pegasus / OpenWBEM /sfcb :
-------------------------------
is done during the "make postinstall".

- with OpenCimom/SNIA CIMOM :
---------------------------
Start the cimbrowser (/usr/sniacimom/bin). Load the schema file Linux_Samba.mof with 
"File" -> "Reload Mof" into the namespace root/cimv2. Before at least IBMQualifiers, 
CIM Core and CIM System schemata have to be loaded into the repository.
