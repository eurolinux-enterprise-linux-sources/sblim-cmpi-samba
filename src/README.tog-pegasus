OpenPegasus post install steps
==============================

When this package is installed (as RPM) on a system with the OpenPegasus 
CIM server (tog-pegasus), it may be necessary to perform some extra 
post install steps. These are:

Provider Registration:
----------------------

Upon installation it is attempted to register the providers with Pegasus.
This can fail if the tog-pegasus service is not running AND cimmofl 
(the Pegasus offline MOF compiler) isn't installed.

In this case it is necessary to run the following command with tog-pegasus
running:

/usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/provider-register.sh -t pegasus \
    -r /usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/Linux_Samba.registration \
    -m /usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/Linux_Samba.mof

Make Sure Providers Can Be Found:
---------------------------------

The providers of this package are installed into the /usr/lib/cmpi (or 
/usr/lib64/cmpi) directory. Depending on the configuration of Pegasus
this directory might not be in the search path for providers.

In this case you should create symbolic links to the Pegasus provider
directory by issueing the following command:

ln -s /usr/lib/cmpi/lib* /usr/lib/Pegasus/providers

assuming that /usr/lib/Pegasus/providers is the configured Pegasus provider
directory.

Provider Deregistration:
------------------------

In order to properly de-register the providers when deinstalling this
package the tog-pegasus service must be active. The deinstallation will
fail otherwise.

Alternatively it is possible to deregister the providers BEFORE uninstalling 
this package with the following command:

/usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/provider-register.sh -d -t pegasus \
    -r /usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/Linux_Samba.registration \
    -m /usr/share/sblim-cmpi-samba/Linux_Samba.mof
